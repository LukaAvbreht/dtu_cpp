# Week 2 Basic C++

Slides are the start of the exercise

## Functions

The most important notion in computer science and software development!

If the function has side effects, we can get different outputs on the same input (side effects)

#### Stack vs Heap

When you invoke the function you reserve part of Stack for parameters. Once the function is complete,
the stack data will be cleaned

## main_w02.cpp

* Incrementing and stack overflow
    * This can happen
    * it is where we go over the data type limits


* comments : `// code`
* multiline comments: `/* code */`

## \<iomanip>

* setprecision (setting double / float precision)


### \<math>

* standard math library
